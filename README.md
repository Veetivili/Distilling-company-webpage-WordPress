### Production

Wordpress site was built in local host. We moved SQL database to cloud and used gitlab to push new commits.  

Page was built using Ocean WP theme to get top navigation, layout and on page navigation was done by elementor and footer was done with elements kit.  
I created responsive layuout for all pages including content and pictures with help of Santtu Korpisalo. I also created top navigation and on site navigation for mobile.  
Hanna Salminen was responsible of footer and on page navigation for desktop and tablet.

Migrating from local host to customers web servers was done by me.

This whole project was completed in 4 weeks. Everyone of us were using WordPress for the first time.
